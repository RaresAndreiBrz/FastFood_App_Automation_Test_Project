# ** FAST FOOD Project**
## *TEST PLAN*
</br>


### 1. <ins>Introduction<ins>
        In the pursuit of enhancing my skills and venturing into uncharted territories, I have chosen to embark on this
      project on a widely accessed platform in today's digital landscape. This platform belongs to a company that 
      provides fast food delivery services.Although it offers a limited range of products, the functionalities and the 
      imperative for this application to perform optimally have motivated me to apply my expertise to it. Furthermore, 
      the seriousness of the project, being an automated testing endeavor, underscores the importance of precision and 
      thoroughness in its execution.
### 2. <ins>Project details<ins>
   #### 2.1 How I started
        I've decided to approach this project by thoroughly testing various aspects of the website, including 
      functionalities, links, buttons, and so forth, on each individual page. Subsequently, I'll explore combined 
      functionalities and their interconnectedness. As a user, my aim is to uncover every facet of the application, 
      gaining comprehensive knowledge not only about the company but also its products. Furthermore, I'm interested in 
      evaluating the user experience, ensuring the application's security, and verifying the accuracy of its functionalities.
   #### 2.2 The beginnings of the project
        I've initiated the project by creating foundational files aimed at selecting the Chrome browser and the application 
      upon which the tests will be executed.Following that, I proceeded directly to writing the tests and creating them 
      based on specific requirements. Upon creating the tests, I then moved on to developing locators and functions 
      corresponding to one or more pages, as well as integrating them at the code level.
   #### 2.3 Tests writting, functions and implementations
        In the process of executing the tests incrementally, I paid close attention to the feedback generated by each 
      test run. This allowed me to identify any errors or inconsistencies and promptly address them. Additionally, 
      I focused on organizing the code in a logical and structured manner, making it easier for other team members or 
      stakeholders to comprehend and navigate through the files. By refining the test execution workflow and enhancing 
      code readability, I aimed to streamline the testing process and ensure clarity for any future review or modifications,
      even when working individually. This organizational approach helps maintain efficiency and reduces potential confusion as 
      the project progresses.
   #### 2.4 Retesting and refactoring
        Upon completion of the project, I conducted a comprehensive retesting phase to personally verify both the tests 
      and the code against the unchanged application. This retesting served as a final validation step to ensure the 
      reliability and accuracy of the tests, as well as the stability of the application. Additionally, it provided an 
      opportunity to generate a detailed report on the application's status, highlighting any potential issues or areas 
      for improvement. This final step not only reaffirmed the integrity of the project but also equipped stakeholders 
      with valuable insights for future iterations or maintenance efforts.
   #### 2.5 End point
        At the conclusion of these activities, I proceeded to create a comprehensive report tailored to simplify the 
      understanding of the application's status for myself as the sole contributor or for the application owner. 
      This report succinctly presented the results of the tests, indicating whether each test passed or failed, along 
      with any issues identified during the testing process. By providing this concise summary, the report allowed me 
      to quickly assess the overall status of the application and the effectiveness of my testing efforts. Additionally,
      it served as a valuable reference point for decision-making, enabling me to prioritize and address any identified
      issues promptly. Overall, the report played a crucial role in facilitating self-assessment and ensuring the 
      transparency of the testing process.
   #### 2.6 Tests results
        Most tests passed, 72 out of 76
        Few tests have failed, 4 out of 76
   #### 2.7 Bugs report
        The first test that fails is the one confirming the functionality of creating a new account. Due to security 
      reasons, in automated mode, it's not possible to click on the final button required for creating the account.
      Manually, the account can be created. 
        The test targeting the confirmation of the presence of buttons to add products to favorites fails. Manually, 
      these buttons are visible, but in automation, they do not appear. 
        The test confirming the functionality of the 'About Weights and Allergens' button in the submenu of the 'About' 
      button does not pass in automation, as it fails to open the necessary PDF as per the initial manual testing process. 
        The test checking the presence of images in the ninth news article of the 'News' section fails, indicating their 
      absence on the page.

   #### * NOTE
        Due to security and privacy policies, as well as the lack of an official collaboration within an organized 
      framework, the code in this work is not flawless. There are deliberately set wait times, executions, and actions 
      that can be run but are commented out (tests made inactive for this reason), with the intention of not surpassing 
      or attempting to surpass the barriers imposed by the application. For these reasons, the code exhibits imperfections 
      and commented lines, as well as repeated simple actions.
        Furthermore, the name of the application will not be found in this work, nor will the credentials used to perform 
      the tests. For these reasons, this work becomes a demo of a project aimed at my professional and personal development 
      and nothing more.
        Also, the process of creating a report is part of the same issue. Of course there are ways to create a report, but that means
      doing processes that I spoke about above and that I preffer to not do. I realised that during my work and I decided to move on
      since it is just for learning porposes only.

## 3. <ins>Test Implementation<ins>
        The environment used was PyCharm IDE, utilizing Python 3 as the programming language. Chrome browser was selected 
      for running the tests. 
        For libraries, Selenium, ActionChains, htmlrunner, BDD, and time were chosen. To run this project on another 
      system, it is necessary to install all of the aforementioned libraries correctly.
   
#### 4. Other Mentions   
### Target
        The tests were done on 'DUE TO SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY REASONS, THE APP WILL NOT BE DISPLAYED' website.

### Risks
        Lack of experience, unstable internet connection, application protocols, application security, limited scalability, 
      individual work are some of the factors that may contribute to a decrease in the quality of this work.


### CONCLUSIONS
        After conducting the tests, I can conclude that the application operates exactly as desired by the owner. First of all,
      from my perspective, security is at a high level, which is highly satisfactory considering the presence of personal data. 
        Secondly, the interface is user-friendly and very easy to navigate. Everything is clear and concise, well-structured, 
      and of high quality. 
        Thirdly, the application's functionalities are of optimal quality. Buttons function correctly, the shopping cart
      presents no issues, and the ordering and payment processes are well-refined and functional. 
        As for negative aspects, from my viewpoint, the lack of a product sorting option presents a minor drawback. 
      Implementing sorting options such as 'out of stock' or 'by price' could provide users with a much shorter search 
      time and the ability to combine different products in a single search. 
        Although the application features a small number of products, the absence of a search button is considered a 
      disadvantage. As a user, I'm forced to spend a lot of time on what appears to be a simple search at first glance. 
      And let's not forget, a user present on the application is generally one who is hungry.
        Another downside I would like to highlight is the presence of the news page. Depending on individual perception,
      I personally believe that a modification should be made as there are few news articles over a long period of time. 
      A more active presence with news related to employees, locations, sales, etc., would make it a more dynamic part 
      of the site, positively impacting both the application and the company. Both employees and those seeking employment 
      would see that their activities are noticed, important, and highlighted. I believe their joy in being part of the 
      company would increase considerably, and the number of those seeking employment would also improve. 
        In conclusion, while the application demonstrates many strengths, addressing these identified areas for 
      improvement could enhance the overall user experience and contribute to the company's success.
